                                                      üöÄ Learning Platform‚Äôs Speed Up with End-to-End CI/CD and GitOps on AWS

üß© Problem Statement

A growing online learning platform operates a mix of legacy monolithic applications and modern microservices. Currently, its deployments are manual and error-prone, with inconsistent quality checks and limited observability.
This results in:

Delayed releases and high deployment risks

Lack of standardization across environments

Difficulty in maintaining and monitoring production systems

The challenge is to design and implement a fully automated, production-grade CI/CD and GitOps workflow that can:

Automate the build, test, and deployment processes

Enforce code quality and security standards

Manage immutable artifacts

Deploy consistently to Kubernetes clusters

Offer full visibility and monitoring across environments

üí° Solution Overview

This project implements an end-to-end DevOps pipeline using modern tools and best practices on AWS Cloud.
The solution integrates the following components:

Function	Tool/Technology
Infrastructure as Code	Terraform
Continuous Integration	Jenkins / GitHub Actions
Code Quality	SonarQube
Artifact Repository	JFrog Artifactory
Containerization	Docker
Package Management	Helm
Continuous Deployment (GitOps)	ArgoCD
Container Orchestration	Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)
Monitoring & Visualization	Prometheus & Grafana
Domain & TLS	Route53 and Ingress Controller
üîß Implementation Flow

Provision Infrastructure: Create AWS resources (VPC, EKS, IAM roles) using Terraform.

Setup CI Tools: Configure Jenkins or GitHub Actions for build and test automation.

Enable Quality Gates: Integrate SonarQube for code analysis and enforce quality thresholds.

Containerize and Store: Build Docker images and push them to Artifactory.

Deploy via GitOps: Use ArgoCD to automatically sync manifests/Helm charts from Git to EKS.

Monitor Everything: Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for real-time metrics and alerting.

üéØ Aim of the Project

To build and demonstrate a complete CI/CD and GitOps-based DevOps ecosystem that accelerates software delivery while ensuring quality, security, and observability in a cloud-native environment.

The project aims to:

Deliver a reliable, automated deployment pipeline for an online learning platform

Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent environment provisioning

Integrate CI/CD and GitOps principles to achieve continuous, error-free delivery

Develop a resume-ready, portfolio-grade DevOps project showcasing real-world tools and workflows
