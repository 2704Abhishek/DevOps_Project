### üöÄ Learning Platform‚Äôs Speed Up with End-to-End CI/CD and GitOps on AWS

# üß© Problem Statement

A growing online learning platform operates a mix of legacy monolithic applications and modern microservices. Currently, its deployments are manual and error-prone, with inconsistent quality checks and limited observability.
This results in:

Delayed releases and high deployment risks

Lack of standardization across environments

Difficulty in maintaining and monitoring production systems

The challenge is to design and implement a fully automated, production-grade CI/CD and GitOps workflow that can:

Automate the build, test, and deployment processes

Enforce code quality and security standards

Manage immutable artifacts

Deploy consistently to Kubernetes clusters

Offer full visibility and monitoring across environments


# üí° Solution Overview


This project implements an end-to-end DevOps pipeline using modern tools and best practices on AWS Cloud.
The solution integrates the following components:

# üîß Implementation Flow


1. Provision Infrastructure: Create AWS resources (VPC, EKS, IAM roles) using Terraform.

2. Setup CI Tools: Configure Jenkins or GitHub Actions for build and test automation.

3. Enable Quality Gates: Integrate SonarQube for code analysis and enforce quality thresholds.

4. Containerize and Store: Build Docker images and push them to Artifactory.

5. Deploy via GitOps: Use ArgoCD to automatically sync manifests/Helm charts from Git to EKS.

6. Monitor Everything: Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for real-time metrics and alerting.



# üéØ Aim of the Project
